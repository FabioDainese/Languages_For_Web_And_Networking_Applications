# Introduction
This exercise was designed to familiarize with the [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) library. 

# Task Description
Given the [*initial_template.html*](initial_template.html) web page as a starting point, which contains four images and two buttons, you'll need to design a photo galley (carousel) using the functions made available by the jQuery library, such that:

* The photos need to scroll/slide by clicking one of the two buttons (Prev/Next);
* The photos need to scroll/slide in a cyclic way;
* The sliding process needs to be accompanied by some animation (e.g. FadeIn/FadeOut);

The only parts that can be changed on the provided HTML page are the `SCRIPT` and `STYLE` blocks, basically the exercise consists in manipulating the elements of the DOM and their properties.

It's not allowed using `FOR/FOREACH` cycles (neither the `EACH` jQuery function) to slide through the elements (images). You cannot use external plugins or libraries for the gallery management.

# Result/Testing
You can run the developed application by opening the `final_result.html` through a browser. The expected result should be equals to the one represented in the following GIF:
