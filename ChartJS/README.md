# Introduction
This exercise was designed to familiarize with the [Chart.JS](https://www.chartjs.org/) library. 

# Task Description
Use the *Chart.js* library to view some earthquakes on a map. Earthquakes must be visualized by "bubbles" with a radius corresponding to the magnitude of the earthquake.

You must enter at least 2 datasets with at least 4 earthquakes each. For example, in the first dataset you can divide the less strong earthquakes, and in the second one those with greater magnitude. You have extreme freedom of choice on the data of the datasets (they can also be invented/fake).

When passing over the bubble with the mouse you'll need to display:
* City or latitude/longitude;
* Magnitude of the earthquake;
* Earthquake date (even just the year).

Finally the bubbles/earthquakes must not appear on the map all together, but one at a time based on the date.

# Result/Testing
You can run the developed application by opening the `index.html` through a browser. The expected result should be equals to the one represented in the following GIF:
