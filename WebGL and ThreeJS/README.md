# Introduction
This exercise was designed to familiarize with the [three.js](https://threejs.org/) library. 

# Task Description
Develop a Javascript application (using the `three.js` library) that shows a 3D simulation of the motion of some planets in a hypothetical solar system.

The system is composed of a star (e.g. the sun), placed in the center, and two main planets that orbit around the star with circular orbits of radius `r2 > r1`.

Each of the planets has a moon that orbits around it. Even in this case, for simplicity, consider the circular orbits.
